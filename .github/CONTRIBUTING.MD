# How to contribute ?

Thanks you for your interest in our project and making it better ❤️

If you wish to make a modification simply fork the project and send me a pull request, I will happily review your modifications and add them to our project !

## Starting the base app

The application given with this project is a basic `React Native` application, simply follow the [React Native Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to start it.

## Where to show my new additions ?

Just put your new components on the `ComponentsPresentationPage` so everyone can see it

After adding your new component just add a bit of documentation to the readme on how to work with it, if not possible for any reason, contact me and I will help you to make a documentation !

Thanks a lot for your contributions !
